**We used all Recommended style sheets such BOOTSTRAP,JQuery... to improve the quality of displayed content and to improved performance at all possible times**

The libraries are found in the assets folder, we downloaded them and stored them for easier access(Offline). The same stylesheets was used to animate some content in the webpage. Separate folders was created for each party, multiple professional reservation websites style sheets and layouts was used as references and guidance to design the webpage. Most pages was designed by naming specific classes to refer the original style sheets sytaxes to get our preferred output, bootstrap preformats helped this process. 
Many sources were referred to understand and to implement certain functions such as navigation menus.
